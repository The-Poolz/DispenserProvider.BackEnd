    /// This test documents the root cause and solution for issue #146
    /// 
    /// PROBLEM:
    /// - Transactions sometimes failed on the first attempt due to gas estimation
    /// - Even after manually setting correct gas limit, TX could still fail
    /// - Suspected cause: Signature timestamp generated separately in different modules
    /// - If >500ms elapsed between calls, timestamp rounding could differ by ±1s, causing signature mismatch
    /// 
    /// ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
    /// The SignatureProcessor.SaveSignature() method had multiple DateTime.UtcNow calls:
    /// 1. CalculateValidFrom() called DateTime.UtcNow
    /// 2. CalculateValidUntil() called DateTime.UtcNow separately
    /// 3. These timestamps were used for signature generation and database storage
    /// 
    /// If processing took >500ms between these calls, the Unix timestamp conversion
    /// could result in different values (e.g., 1234567 vs 1234568), causing the
    /// signature to be invalid when validated against the stored data.
    /// 
    /// SOLUTION:
    /// Modified SignatureProcessor to use a single DateTime.UtcNow call and pass
    /// the same baseTimestamp to both calculation methods, ensuring consistency.
    /// 
    /// CHANGES MADE:
    /// 1. Added single baseTimestamp = DateTime.UtcNow in SaveSignature()
    /// 2. Updated CalculateValidFrom(dispenser, baseTimestamp)
    /// 3. Updated CalculateValidUntil(refundFinishTime, isRefund, baseTimestamp)
    /// 4. Both methods now use the same timestamp, eliminating rounding discrepancies

        // 2. [500ms+ delay]
        // 3. Call CalculateValidUntil() -> DateTime.UtcNow = 12:34:57.500 -> Unix: 1234568

        // 5. Database stores ValidFrom with Unix timestamp 1234567

        // AFTER THE FIX (consistent scenario):
        // 1. Single DateTime.UtcNow call -> baseTimestamp = 12:34:56.999
